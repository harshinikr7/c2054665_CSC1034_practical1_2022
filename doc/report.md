<h1>Reflective Report</h1>

Working on the CSC1034 Project 1 has allowed me to get a better idea on various key concepts, ideas and tools. There was a lot of explanatory material that I had to go through in order to understand the critical processes which really guided and aided me in getting a good understanding on the project.

It was my first time using an editor tool like PyCharm and thus I did struggle in using it at the very start but eventually got a hold of it thanks to the instructions and project. Storing my code in a system like GitHub was new to me but I found it to be useful as it allowed me to save my updates in a place and go back to it if and whenever I needed to do so. It took me a while to understand this though and so I do wish there was a more step by step explanation on why we need to use these tools and how to use them effectively as it did get a bit confusing and iffy to work with them.

Github has served as a very handy tool for when I had to import my code to another device or go back to previous versions, especially since I was constantly switching devices. It was a good feeling to not have to fear Iâ€™ll lose my work and to know that everything was stored elsewhere. Github might just be my new favorite tool which I definitely did not expect as it was initially more of a burden to understand and get started with. But now, nearing the end of this project, I feel extremely grateful I was introduced to it and will definitely use it alot more in the future.

I had studied python a few years ago so I did forget most of it and I wish there was some sort of material to go through to understand and learn the basics of the language since I struggled with coding some bits of it and extending the practical. I did eventually get the hang of it as I went through the code multiple times and found patterns in how to code such as defining, initializing and parsing. I was able to pick up the point of these commands and use them to extend the practical in due course.

Markdown is also a tool I found to be very useful as it allowed me to write down this report and store it along with the worked practical instead of having to submit it elsewhere, this allows me to keep all project related information in one place.

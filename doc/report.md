<h1>Reflective Report</h1>

Working on the CSC1034 Project 1 has allowed me to get an idea on various key concepts, ideas and tools. There was a lot of explanatory material that I had to go through in order to understand the critical processes which really guided and aided me in getting a good understanding on the project.

It was my first time using an editor tool like PyCharm and thus I did struggle in using it at the very start but eventually got a hold of it thanks to the instructions and project. Keeping my code in a system like GitHub was new to me as well but I found it to be useful as it allowed me to save my updates in a place and go back to it if and whenever I needed to do so. It took me a while to understand this though and so I do wish there was a more step by step explanation on why we need to use these tools and how to use them effectively as it did get a bit confusing and iffy to work with them.

Markdown is a tool I found to be very useful as I am able to write down this report and store it along with the *worked practical* instead of having to submit it elsewhere, this allowed me to keep all project related information in one place.
